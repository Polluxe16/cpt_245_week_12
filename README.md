This repository has the files for the week 12 assignment. I included the main files from the week 4 repository and the ones I thought would be important.

I did the best I could to make sure the endpoints work, but I was ultimately unable to test them. I spun up the vagrant vm and worked on modifying it so that it would work, but I was unable to do much else. 
Postman was unable to detect anything from it, and even when I attempted to do it with the original one that was shown to work it would not get anything. I think it may be an issue with my PC, and I apologize for the lack of foresight. If I had started earlier I might have been able to fix the issue.

Regardless, I used a few sources to compare by and I think the code should be able to work if run in a proper environment. The REST API should be fully functional, or at least very close to fully functional. I hope it comes close to your expectations.
